# Project Instructions

If you want to check how it works, download the following files and folders:

1. `stop.py`
2. `slow.py`
3. `stopcrosswalk.py`
4. `Models` folder
5. `Test Video` folder

Then, replace the model and video directory paths in the Python scripts (`stop.py`, `slow.py`, `stopcrosswalk.py`) with your own directory paths.

Once this is set up, run the code to test it.

Regards!
